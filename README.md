My PF Lab work
HI! Yahya here! I am a CS student in Fast University with a passion for literature (born to study literature forced to be a CS major in order to earn a living) but here's a few of my favourite authors :p 
Haruki Murakami (If you dont read murakami we might as well stay away from each other)
Osamu Dazai (I know what you're thinking but just hear me out okay)
FRANZ KAFKA!! (thank god this man was not loved as a child cause he's one of the best writers ever!!)
here's a picture of me with my cat (i have 5 they're named Asteroid Destroyer, Ed Sheeran, Kanye West, Optimus Prime and Persephone)
